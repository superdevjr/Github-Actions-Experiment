The purpose of this repository is to experiment with Github Actions. As a self-taught dev seeking my first break, I strive to differentiate myself from other canditates. A mentor had recently told me a handful of skills that might make me an immediate benefit to a company, one of which was Github Actions. Most of the skills he named were DevOps related things that companies may be utitlizing in some fashion, but without someone who is an expert, or even someone with a working knowledge. So, having a beginner knowledge of those things that I could apply may be a sweetener for companies looking to take on a neophyte.
